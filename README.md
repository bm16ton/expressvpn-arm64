# expressvpn-arm64
This is a command line app expvpn and gtk gui expvpn-gtk for expressvpn using nmcli and bash and NOT the expressvpn app
requires gtkdialog https://github.com/bm16ton/gtkdialog, network-manager, and currently the vpn needs to be pre-setup
Tho i will hopefully add installing the config files sometime soon
just copy expvpn and expvpn-gtk to PATH
IE

After installing gtkdialog simply run

sudo ./install.sh
